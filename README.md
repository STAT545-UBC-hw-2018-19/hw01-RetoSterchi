# Get a taste of some RMarkdown functionalities

## Emphasis

To create *bold* or _italic_, wrap with asterisks * or underscores _.

To avoid creating bold or italic, place a backslash in front \* or \_

## Lists
Markdown is a way to style text on the web. We can make handy lists, let's say to keep track of items that we need to complete in the code...

- [x] we have completed this item 
- [ ] this is an incomplete item
- [x] in such a list, even @mentions, #refs, [links](),
**formatting**, and <del>tags</del> are supported

## Images
Shall we present something with a sketch or include a figure? No problem, just insert a link to a graph. For instance, you can use some basic HTML to insert a link to an external image file. 

<img src="https://previews.123rf.com/images/chudtsankov/chudtsankov1706/chudtsankov170600020/79782658-smiling-yellow-star-cartoon-emoji-face-character-with-wink-expression-giving-a-thumb-up-illustration.jpg" alt="drawing" width="200"/>
